**Lucas** — "Ising formulations of many NP problems." *Frontiers in Physics*, 2014.
Shows how a huge class of combinatorial problems (graph coloring, TSP, Sudoku, etc.) can be rewritten as Ising/QUBO problems, making them solvable by annealing hardware. The theoretical backbone for why QUBO is a universal formulation.

**Glover et al.** — "Quantum Bridge Analytics I: QUBO Formulations." *4OR*, 2022.
A practical guide to constructing QUBO matrices — how to encode objectives, constraints, and penalties. Essential reference for the mechanics of building the Q matrix used throughout this project.

**Kirkpatrick et al.** — "Optimization by Simulated Annealing." *Science*, 1983.
The original paper introducing simulated annealing: probabilistic hill-climbing inspired by physical annealing, where temperature controls the acceptance of worse solutions to escape local minima. The classical algorithm this project implements and extends.

**Farhi et al.** — "A Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm." *arXiv:1411.4028*, 2014.
Introduces QAOA, a gate-based quantum circuit approach to combinatorial optimization. Provides the quantum counterpart to simulated annealing and motivates why QUBO formulations matter for near-term quantum devices.

**D-Wave Systems** — "Leap Hybrid BQM Solver." *docs.dwavesys.com*, 2023.
Documentation for the hybrid classical-quantum solver used in experiments. The Leap hybrid solver handles problem sizes too large for the QPU alone by combining quantum annealing with classical heuristics.

**Preskill** — "Quantum Computing in the NISQ Era." *Quantum*, 2018.
Coins the term NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) and contextualizes the realistic capabilities and limitations of today's quantum hardware. Frames why hybrid classical-quantum methods are the practical near-term approach.

**Lewis & Thompson** — "Graph coloring & Sudoku." *Intl. J. Comput. Sci.*, 2022.
Demonstrates graph coloring as a concrete QUBO use case, with Sudoku as an intuitive instance. Used here to ground the abstract QUBO framework in a familiar constraint-satisfaction problem.

**Slepoy et al.** — "QA across 5,000 QUBO instances." *Quantum Mach. Intell.*, 2024.
Large-scale empirical benchmarking of quantum annealing across thousands of QUBO problem instances. Provides evidence for where quantum annealing outperforms, matches, or falls short of classical solvers in practice.

The primary foundational paper this research builds from. A prime example of a grid-based QUBO approach to protein folding — their encoding strategy and formulation structure were the direct inspiration for the QUBO construction used in this project.
